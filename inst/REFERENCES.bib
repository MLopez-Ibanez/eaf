                  performance of stochastic local search algorithms
                  for biobjective optimization problems. These tools
                  are based on the concept of the empirical attainment
                  function (EAF), which describes the probabilistic
                  distribution of the outcomes obtained by a
                  stochastic algorithm in the objective space. In
                  particular, we consider the visualization of
                  attainment surfaces and differences between the
                  first-order EAFs of the outcomes of two
                  algorithms. This visualization allows us to identify
                  certain algorithmic behaviors in a graphical way.
                  We explain the use of these visualization tools and
                  illustrate them with examples arising from
                  practice.}

                  process conditional simulations},
  volume = 243,
  doi = {10.1016/j.ejor.2014.07.032},
  abstract = {Multi-objective optimization algorithms aim at finding
                  Pareto-optimal solutions. Recovering Pareto fronts or Pareto
                  sets from a limited number of function evaluations are
                  challenging problems. A popular approach in the case of
                  expensive-to-evaluate functions is to appeal to
                  metamodels. Kriging has been shown efficient as a base for
                  sequential multi-objective optimization, notably through
                  infill sampling criteria balancing exploitation and
                  exploration such as the Expected Hypervolume
                  Improvement. Here we consider Kriging metamodels not only for
                  selecting new points, but as a tool for estimating the whole
                  Pareto front and quantifying how much uncertainty remains on
                  it at any stage of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization
                  algorithms. Our approach relies on the Gaussian process
                  interpretation of Kriging, and bases upon conditional
                  simulations. Using concepts from random set theory, we
                  propose to adapt the Vorob'ev expectation and deviation to
                  capture the variability of the set of non-dominated
                  points. Numerical experiments illustrate the potential of the
                  proposed workflow, and it is shown on examples how Gaussian
                  process simulations and the estimated Vorob'ev deviation can
                  be used to monitor the ability of Kriging-based
                  multi-objective optimization algorithms to accurately learn
                  the Pareto front.},
