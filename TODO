 * Use eaxis for prettier labels.
 * If the plots were based on ggplot2, we could use plotly to make them
   interactive:

 * Make examples run faster (make data smaller). Move current examples
   to tests/
 * Fix all FIXMEs
 * eafplot.default and .plot.eafdiff.side duplicate a lot of code.
 * Create eafdiff plots with a single plot using two different colors.
 * Profile memory/computation time to find bottle-necks.
 * Implement fast algorithms from:
