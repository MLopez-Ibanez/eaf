eaf_input.c :
 * Experiment with different values for PAGE_SIZE in eaf_input.c.

 * Experiment reading whole lines and then sscanf the line.
 
 * Consider mmaping the input file (or a big chunk of few megabytes),
   then read, then unmap.

 * Perhaps add --obj=X so it reads only that number of columns from input.
